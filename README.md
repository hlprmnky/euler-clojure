=============

Implementation of Project Euler problems in Clojure

Goals: 
 - Learn idiomatic Clojure by applying myself to the problems in Project Euler
 - Learn the Clojure build/run ecosystem, or at least Leiningen

Please note that this project will probably constitute *SPOILERS* for at least early problems in Project Euler - if you don't want to see how I've solved problems, please don't clone/browse this repo! :)
