# euler

A Clojure library designed to
 - Document my progress with Clojure by implementing problems from Project Euler
 - Learn Leiningen and the Clojure ecosystem as I go

## Usage

I was going for something like the interactive test-edit-test loop that the Clojure koans macro setup provides, but we'll see.
